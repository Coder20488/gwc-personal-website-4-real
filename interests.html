            <p> Reading - I have had a love for reading since childhood. It’s my beautiful haven to escape into that helps me feel, think, and understand the world better. Some of my favorite book genres include YA fantasy and mystery. If you ever need a specific book rec, you always know where to ask!</p>

    <p>Coding - I find something very satisfying in the way that you can create something from nothing with pure logic and a special kind of creativity. My coding journey began with creating projects on Scratch, and has since expanded to include robotics, AI, website building, and more.

<p> Dancing - I’ve gotten into Bollywood dancing pretty recently, and it’s been such a fun and exciting way to connect with my culture. I’ve performed at a school rally and in a cultural show in front of over 1,500 people — they are both experiences that I will never forget, they have pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow.
