---MY README--:
This is my personal website project, I made it as a way to improve my html and css skills. I already knew a bit of html and css but it had been a while since I last used them and I wanted to refresh my memory. I made my project using the gwc we development tutorials. I struggled with many syntax errors and learned that if something that I had programmed wasn't showing up on my website, I need to look through my code very carefully for syntax errors and problems get fixed 99 percent of the time!

## File Overview

### ← README.me


### ← index.html

HTML files are for content! Add your text, images, buttons, and more using HTML tags.

### ← style.css

CSS files add styling rules to your content like changing colors and fonts. 

### ← script.js

JavaScript files add interactivity to your website using code. This is where you can listen for events, then take an action.

### ← assets

Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project. You do not need to add anything to this folder unless you are working on the extensions. If you are adding an image, it is best to save it to your computer, then upload the file to the `assets` folder. The url of the image will be `assets/example.jpg`.
